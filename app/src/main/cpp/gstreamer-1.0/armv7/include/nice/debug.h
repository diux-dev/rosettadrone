 * <para>Libnice can output a lot of information when debug messages are enabled.
 * This can significantly help track down problems and/or understand what
 * it's doing.</para>
 *
 * <para>You can enable/disable the debug messages by calling nice_debug_enable()
 * or nice_debug_disable() and choosing whether you want only ICE debug messages
 * or also stun debug messages.</para>
 *
 * <para>By default, the debug messages are disabled, unless the environment
 * variable NICE_DEBUG is set, in which case, it must contain a comma separated
 * list of flags specifying which debug to enable.</para>
 * <para> The currently available flags are "nice", "stun", "pseudotcp",
 * "pseudotcp-verbose" or "all" to enable all debug messages.</para>
 * <para> If the 'pseudotcp' flag is enabled, then 'pseudotcp-verbose' gets
 * automatically disabled. This is to allow the use of the 'all' flag without
 * having verbose messages from pseudotcp. You can enable verbose debug messages
 * from the pseudotcp layer by specifying 'pseudotcp-verbose' without the
 * 'pseudotcp' flag.</para>
 *
 *
 * <para>This API is unstable and is subject to change at any time...
 * More flags are to come and a better API to enable/disable each flag
 * should be added.</para>
