 * The STUN timer usage is a set of helpful utility functions that allows you
 * to easily track when a STUN message should be retransmitted or considered
 * as timed out.

                    STUN_TIMER_DEFAULT_MAX_RETRANSMISSIONS);

   // Loop until we get the response
   for (;;) {
     remainder = stun_timer_remainder(&timer);

     // Poll the socket until data is received or the timer expires
     if (poll (&pollfd, 1, delay) <= 0) {
       // Time out and no response was received
       ret = stun_timer_refresh (&timer);
       if (ret == STUN_USAGE_TIMER_RETURN_TIMEOUT) {
