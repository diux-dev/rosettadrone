 * The width and height of a #graphene_rect_t can be negative; for instance,
 * a #graphene_rect_t with an origin of [ 0, 0 ] and a size of [ 10, 10 ] is
 * equivalent to a #graphene_rect_t with an origin of [ 10, 10 ] and a size
 * of [ -10, -10 ].
 *
 * Application code can normalize rectangles using graphene_rect_normalize();
 * this function will ensure that the width and height of a rectangle are
 * positive values. All functions taking a #graphene_rect_t as an argument
 * will internally operate on a normalized copy; all functions returning a
 * #graphene_rect_t will always return a normalized rectangle.
